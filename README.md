# Bike Sharing Analysis with XGBoost

This repository contains code and visualizations for analyzing the **Bike Sharing Dataset** using machine learning techniques, specifically the XGBoost model. The goal of this project is to predict bike rental counts based on various environmental and operational factors.

## Dataset Information

The **Bike Sharing Dataset** comes from a bike-sharing system in **Washington, D.C., USA**. It contains historical usage data from the **Capital Bikeshare** program, which operates in Washington, D.C., and nearby areas.

### Key Details:
- **City**: Washington, D.C.
- **Country**: United States
- **Bike Sharing System**: Capital Bikeshare
- **Time Period**: 2011â€“2012

The dataset provides features such as weather conditions, holidays, and seasonal information, making it ideal for regression and time-series forecasting tasks.

## Project Overview

The notebook includes the following:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Removed unnecessary columns: `instant`, `dteday`, `casual`, and `registered`.
   - A separate workflow excludes the `yr` (year) column for a secondary analysis.
2. **Modeling**:
   - Trained an XGBoost Regressor model to predict the total bike rental count (`cnt`).
   - Evaluated the model using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
3. **Visualizations**:
   - **Predicted vs Actual Values**: Scatter plot to assess the model's performance.
   - **Residual Plot**: Highlights the residual distribution across predicted values.
   - **Feature Importance**: Bar plot showing the importance of each feature.
   - **Error Distribution**: Histogram of residual errors to examine model fit.
